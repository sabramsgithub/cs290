<p>Germinal is the thirteenth novel in Ã‰mile Zola's twenty-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart. Often considered Zola's masterpiece and one of the most significant novels in the French tradition, the novel - an uncompromisingly harsh and realistic story of a coalminers' strike in northern France in the 1860s - has been published and translated in over one hundred countries. It has also inspired five film adaptations and two television productions.</p>
